# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Purpose:
 The purpose is to help Louise's play Fever, find out how differnt campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
 
##Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    The row labels were changed to display the months of the year, and the campaign outcomes are sorted in descending order. And a line chart is created showing the number of successful, failed, or canceled projects by month, it has a title 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Created the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled projects and calculated based on the data from the "Total Projects," "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns. Also created a line chart with goaal amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful, failed or canceed projects on the y-axis, and had a title of "Outcomes based on Goals". 
    
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered.
        Challenegs and diffculties include using countifs function especially have the correct filters on pledges. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. For all grand total came out as 2185 for successful, 1520 for failed, and 349 for canceled. 
    2. For theatre, the grand total is 839 for successful, 493 for failed and 37 for canceled. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   We used "countifs" function to calculate the number of successful, failed and canceled. Then used "sum" function to calculetd the number of total projects, and the used successful, failed and canceled divided by total projects each to have the final percentage. Eventually turned the percentage rate in to the line graph, shown on the sheet. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
        Some limitations are this datset is only for a certain amount of people, it doesn't include all the data. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
        We could create some bar graph, also some pie graph. Just to give the reader a different look at our analysis.
